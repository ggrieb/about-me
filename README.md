About Me project for Code 201

Synopsis
This began as a day-2 assignment for Code 201 at Code Fellows.  The objective is to gain experience with IDE by way of creating a webpage that has a js question and answer "game" about me, the author.

Version 1.1 Notes: Padding and margin adjustments added to multiple CSS fields.  Text of the javascript questions changed.

Version 1.2 Notes: 2-8-2018 Tone shift to a more presentable 'job-seeker' format from more 'interweb-goofy' format.  Including new picture changes and corresponding CSS/html changes.  Efforts to clean up code formatting.  Additional js questions that made use of for loop and while loop, and html lists.

Version 2.0 Notes: Added logic from questions into functions 2/8/2018 Yaspesberro
