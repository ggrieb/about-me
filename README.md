About Me project for Code 201

Synopsis
This began as a day-2 assignment for Code 201 at Code Fellows.  The objective is to gain experience with IDE by way of creating a webpage that has a js question and answer "game" about me, the author.

Version 0.2 Notes: Padding and margin adjustments added to multiple CSS fields.  Text of the javascript questions changed.

Version 0.3 Notes: 2-8-2018 Tone shift to a more presentable 'job-seeker' format from more 'interweb-goofy' format.  Including new picture changes and corresponding CSS/html changes.  Efforts to clean up code formatting.  Additional js questions that made use of for loop and while loop, and html lists.

Version 0.4 Notes: Logic from questions were put into functions on 2/8/2018 by 'driver' Y. Yaspesberro (username: Yaspesberro).

Version 0.5 Notes: Fixed my spacing issues in my code editor and added an alert that gave all possible answers.  Removed a redundant part of code from q7.

Version 1.0 Notes: Deployment day 2/11/2008.  Multiple changes made to CSS and HTML, content added.
