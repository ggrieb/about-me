    <h2><a name="Misc"></a>} Background {</h2>
    <p>
    Currently an aspiring software developer training at Code Fellows, and also licensed by the WSBA to practice law in the State of Washington.</br></br>

    Born and raised in the Puget Sound town of Everett, Washington, located at the mouth of the Snohomish River.  After graduating from Gonzaga University in 2007, I moved to Seattle to attend the University of Washington for graduate school. While earning my Master of Communication I worked for a media software and services company and gained experience in digital media (CMS and content production) and project management (agile).</br></br>

    In 2011, I left that company to attend law school where I practiced with public defenders (criminal defense attorneys) in courtrooms of both the Republic of Ireland and the United States.  I also helped artisan merchants, gallery owners, and artists of various types, with their business and contract needs by working at the Washington Lawyers for the Arts (WLA) Legal Clinic.</br></br>

    After graduating law school in 2014, my spouse, newborn child, and I, spent about two years living in two opposite ends of the USA before returning to the Great Pacific Northwest.  In June of 2017, I formed Grieb Legal PLLC, which focuses on document review and contract drafting.</br></br>

    Q: What was your first (non-family) job?</br></br>
    A: Ages 16-17 I worked as a 'Kennel Helper', which basically meant I was a janitor at a veterinary clinic.  Plenty of messy clean-up, it could get a little sad when people say goodbye to their pets (and I then had to do 'morgue' duty), but there were also times when you would be swarmed by adorable liters of puppies.</br></br>

    Q: What is that in your background image?</br></br>
    A: That is based on a picture I took at Golden Gardens Park containing one of two herons I see on my Monday morning 10k.  I felt the background was missing something, so I put a bird on it.</br></br>
